# Recursive bomberman
The goal of this project is to create a simple bomberman game, but with a twist. The real challenge with 
this game comes with the fact that you **cant use object-oriented programming**. And, as the title says,
it needs to be exclusively recursive. That means that iteration is forbidden. This is a project for CE1101,
Computer Engineering, Costa Rica Institute of Technology.
