# Recursive bomberman
The goal of this project is to create a simple bomberman game, but with a twist. The real challenge with 
this game comes with the fact that you **cant use object-oriented programming** or pygame (i mean, 
you can use pygame only for the music). And, as the title says,
it needs to be exclusively recursive. That means that iteration is forbidden. Also, object-oriented programming is also forbidden for this game. This is a project for CE1101,
Computer Engineering, Costa Rica Institute of Technology. Further information (in spanish) in ***documentacion.pdf***

## Installation
Install the required libraries. Make sure that if you're using Linux, **make sure you have Tkinter installed**

```sh 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Gameplay 
You move with the arrow keys and place bombs with space bar. Make sure that you have enough points to complete the level. In order to do that, you need to **collect the key and find the door**. Both, key and door, will be generated randomly
inside one of the breakable blocks,
